# About Me
I'm a millenial (born 1993) who loves science, technology, and my family. I'm a Web Design and Development major and a delivery driver. No kids yet. I'm basically from Washington D.C. (nobody knows where Annapolis, MD is), but born in Baltimore.

# Family
My Dad was an industrial engineer who was a big inspiration to me and a hilarious redneck. My mom is the sweetest woman in the whole world and much less redneck. My wife is a registered behavior technician with a degree in Psychology. We were sealed in the Philadelphia Temple in 2021. A "sealing" (well, a "sealing" between husband and wife) is an eternal marriage that doesn't end at "'til death do us part."

# What is a Sealing Power??

Jesus Christ said to Peter, whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. He gave him that sealing power. Sadly it disappeared when the apostles were killed. As unlikely as it sounds, Jesus Christ restored His Church and that power back to the Earth. You can learn more at comeuntochrist.org.
